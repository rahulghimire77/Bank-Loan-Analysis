# Loan Default Prediction (Datathon Project)

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for predicting the **grade** of a loan (which can be an indicator of loan default risk) using various classification algorithms. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training using different classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBoost, KNN)  
- Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and XGBoost  
- Evaluation using performance metrics such as accuracy score and classification report  
- Visualization of the confusion matrix for the best model

## Data

- **Source**: The code expects a CSV file named `train.csv`

- Adjust the path to the location of your dataset if needed.

- **Description**: The dataset contains information about loans (e.g., annual income, debt-to-income ratio, interest rates, loan amount, home ownership, etc.) as well as a target label (`grade`) indicating the credit grade of the loan.
